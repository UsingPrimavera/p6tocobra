# P6ToCobra - Replacement for Deltek Cobra's P6 Integration

The goal of P6ToCobra is to provide a better P6 integration experience for users of Deltek Cobra and let it be easy to install and configure.

P6ToCobra intends to add the following features not available from Deltek:
* Extract data from a baseline attached to a project in P6
* Handle P6 Project Ids that contain spaces
* Save a copy of the data file created
* Produce a log file with clearer information

## Download
Once we have a working version, we will provide a url to download it here.

## Installation
Installation instructions will appear here.  They should involve copying our release files over the existing Deltek Cobra files in the p3eapi directory.

## Configuration
A file will be provided with instructions for configuring the integration.  Initially this will support the use of a P6 Integration Server.

## License
P6ToCobra is released under the MIT license.

## Support
Once we have a working version we will create somewhere for it to be supported.
